# OPM

OPM (Oracle Package Manager) is a package manager designed for Oracle database applications. Its primary functions include:

 * ***Packaging:*** Standardizing the format of any SQL or PL/SQL application.
 * ***Installation:*** Deploying packages to a target environment.
 * ***Uninstallation***: Removing packages from a target environment.
 * ***Updating:*** Modifying existing packages in a target environment.
 * ***Distribution:*** Publishing packages to a shared registry (local or remote) for centralized management.

# Understanding the Core Concepts

Before diving into code, it's essential to grasp the fundamental principles of package management:

- ***Package format:*** Decide on a structure for your packages (e.g., .tar.gz, .deb, .rpm).
- ***Metadata:*** Define how you'll store package information (name, version, dependencies, etc.).
- ***Repository:*** Determine where packages will be stored (local, remote, distributed).
- ***Dependency resolution:*** Implement algorithms to handle package dependencies and conflicts.
- ***Installation/removal:*** Define how packages will be installed, upgraded, and removed.
- ***User interface:*** Choose a way for users to interact with your package manager (CLI, GUI).

# Defining the Scope

It's crucial to narrow down the focus of your package manager. Consider these questions:

- ***Target platform:*** Will it be Linux, macOS, Windows, or a specific environment?
- ***Package types:*** Will it handle system packages, programming language packages, or both?
- ***Features:*** What core functionalities are essential? (e.g., search, install, update, remove)
- ***Distro-specific considerations:*** If targeting Linux, will it integrate with a specific distribution?

# Technical Implementation

Once you have a clear scope, you can start building the core components:

- ***Package format:*** Choose a suitable format or create your own. Consider compression, metadata inclusion, and installation scripts.
- ***Repository:*** Set up a structure for storing packages. This could be a local directory, a remote server, or a distributed system.
- ***Metadata:*** Define a data structure to hold package information. Consider using JSON, YAML, or XML.
- ***Dependency resolution:*** Implement algorithms to handle dependencies and conflicts. This can be challenging and requires careful consideration.
- ***Installation/removal:*** Create functions to install, upgrade, and remove packages. This involves copying files, running scripts, and updating package databases.
- ***User interface:*** Develop a CLI or GUI for users to interact with your package manager.

# Additional Considerations

- ***Security:*** Implement measures to verify package integrity and protect user systems.
- ***Performance:*** Optimize package downloads, installations, and updates for speed.
- ***Error handling:*** Provide informative error messages and recovery options.
- ***Testing:*** Thoroughly test your package manager with various scenarios.





# Getting start

To get start, I'll try to start building a MVP to be considered as POC.
